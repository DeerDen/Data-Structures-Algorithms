Thank you for contributing, We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

**1.** Fork the repo.  
**2.** Make changes to the repository (document the changes)  
**3.** Create a [pull request](https://github.com/DeerDen/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/pulls) with a meaningful title.  
**4.** Issue that pull request!
